        <p>Using the state level data in 2018, this project studied the relationship between hospital resources and life expectancy in each state. We used the number of people sharing one hospital to measure the hospital resources. In this project, we presented the life expectancy and hospital data through histogram, clustered bar plots, geographic maps, and line plots. Then, by conducting linear regression between the number of people sharing one hospital(X) and life expectancy(Y), we found that in the states where more people share one hospital, the life expectancy is higher, which contradicts our prediction. After reflecting on our project, we came up with some plausible explanations. One limitation in our project is that we did not take into consideration the size of the hospitals. In addition, we found out that the states with higher life expectancy and larger number of people sharing one hospital  are usually more populous states and have more cities, where there may be larger hospitals. In contrast, the states where there are fewer number of people sharing one hospital are usually less populous states with smaller hospitals. Considering this limitation, we hope to include the number of beds in each hospital and population density data into our project for further research to make more precise predictions.</p>
